For the full prototype, you need to include Bootstrap Icons:

1. Download Bootstrap Icons from https://icons.getbootstrap.com/
2. Extract the files to this directory
3. Ensure bootstrap-icons.css is in this folder

Alternatively, you can use the CDN version by adding this to the _Layout.cshtml file:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap-icons@1.11.2/font/bootstrap-icons.min.css">
